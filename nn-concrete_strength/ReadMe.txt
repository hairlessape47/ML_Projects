This project applies machine learning to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its material composition. The dataset includes inputs such as cement, water, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and chemical admixtures. I built a neural network using Keras with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss to model the relationship between these inputs and the resulting strength of concrete. I tested different hidden layer sizes, activation functions, learning rates, and batch sizes to see how they affect model accuracy. I also compared two-layer and three-layer network structures. The results include training and testing performance as well as error values, showing how neural networks can be tuned to capture patterns in material property data.
