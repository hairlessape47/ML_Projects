This project brings together several machine learning methods applied to real scientific datasets. 
I built and tested models for both regression and classification, as well as unsupervised learning and sequence modeling.

- Perovskite Stability (Regression): Used decision trees and random forests to predict when perovskite
  materials begin to degrade. Evaluated models with leave-one-out cross validation and studied feature
  importance to see which chemical and process variables matter most.

- Alanine Dipeptide Dynamics (PCA and Clustering): Applied principal component analysis (PCA),
  implemented both from scratch and with scikit-learn, to reduce molecular dynamics data into lower
  dimensions. Used K-Means clustering to identify dominant conformations and compared results with dihedral angle patterns.

- Solubility Classification (Neural Networks): Trained neural networks in Keras to classify
  whether molecules are soluble in water using 18 molecular descriptors. Tuned hidden layer
  sizes, activation functions, learning rates, and batch sizes. Compared two-layer and
  three-layer models to see how depth affects accuracy.

- Drag Coefficient Prediction (Image Regression with Neural Networks): Predicted drag
  coefficients of 2D shapes in laminar flow using image data. Built a fully connected
  neural network on flattened images and compared it with convolutional neural networks
   (with and without padding). Measured test accuracy, model complexity, and visualized shape features linked to high and low drag.

These projects highlight my ability to use regression, classification, PCA, clustering, and recurrent neural networks to analyze 
and model scientific and engineering data. The work shows how machine learning methods can be applied to practical problems in materials and process systems.
