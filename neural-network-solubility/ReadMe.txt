This project applies a neural network to predict whether chemical compounds are soluble in water based on their molecular features. The dataset includes 18 descriptors such as MolLogP, number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and ring counts. I built and trained a model with two hidden layers using Keras, the Adam optimizer, and binary crossentropy loss. I tested different hyperparameters, including the number of neurons, activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, selu, elu, exponential), learning rates, and batch sizes. I also compared models with two hidden layers versus three hidden layers to see how added complexity affects performance. For each case, I tracked training and testing accuracy and created confusion matrices to evaluate classification results. This project shows how neural networks can be tuned and evaluated for a real-world scientific dataset.
