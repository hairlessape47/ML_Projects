This project shows how I applied different machine learning methods to scientific datasets. It has two parts. In the first part, I built models to predict when perovskite materials start to degrade. I used decision trees and random forests, and I checked their performance with leave-one-out cross validation. I also looked at which features were most important for the predictions. In the second part, I studied molecular dynamics data for alanine dipeptide. I used principal component analysis (both my own code and scikit-learn) to reduce the data to a few key components, and then applied K-Means clustering to find different molecular shapes. Together, these steps show how regression, feature importance, PCA, and clustering can be used to make sense of scientific data.
